# Swift-Final-Project-BostonSeefood
This app uses CoreML to classify images taken by the camera using two ML models. 


## Hotdog Not Hotdog
The first classification is inspired by the HBO series "Sillicon Valley". In the show they create an app called "Seefood" that allows a user to take a picture of any food and the app will correctly classify the food. However, there are only two possible classifications: "Hotdog" and "Not Hotdog". This coreML model was trained on hundreds of pictures tagged as Hotdogs and hundreds of pictures tagged as Not Hotdog, in order to produce accurate results.
