# Swift-Final-Project-BostonSeefood
This app uses CoreML to classify images taken by the camera using two ML models. 


## Hotdog Not Hotdog
The first classification is inspired by the HBO series "Sillicon Valley". In the show they create an app called "Seefood" that allows a user to take a picture of any food and the app will correctly classify the food. However, there are only two possible classifications: "Hotdog" and "Not Hotdog". This coreML model was trained on hundreds of pictures tagged as Hotdogs and hundreds of pictures tagged as Not Hotdog, in order to produce accurate results.

## Boston Sports 
The second classification is for the 4 major Boston sports teams (Bruins, Celtics, Patriots, Red Sox). The same training method was used for this model. The model was trained on hundreds of picutres of all four teams with the correct tags associated with each picture.
